Therefore, it is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of positives, both correctly classified (the true positives) as well as incorrectly classified (the false negatives)\n",
    "- The specificity of a model (also called the true negative rate) measures the proportion of negative examples that were correctly classified. As with sensitivity, this is computed as the number of true negatives, divided by the total number of negatives—the true negatives plus the false positives\n",
    "- The precision (also known as the positive predictive value) is defined as the proportion of positive examples that are truly positive; in other words, when a model predicts the positive class, how often is it correct? A precise model will only predict the positive class in cases that are very likely to be positive. It will be very trustworthy.\n",
    "- On the other hand, recall is a measure of how complete the results are. This is defined as the number of true positives over the total number of positives. You may have already recognized this as the same as sensitivity. However, in this case, the interpretation differs slightly. A model with a high recall captures a large portion of the positive examples, meaning that it has wide breadth. For example, a search engine with a high recall returns a large number of documents pertinent to the search query. Similarly, the SMS spam filter has a high recall if the majority of spam messages are correctly identified."
